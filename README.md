# NP-Completeness Visualizer

An interactive visualization tool that demonstrates the relationships between different NP-complete problems through polynomial-time reductions.

## Features

- Interactive force-directed graph visualization of NP-complete problems
- Drag and drop nodes to explore relationships
- Hover over problems to see detailed descriptions
- Reset view functionality
- Clear visualization of reduction relationships

## Problems Included

- Boolean Satisfiability (SAT)
- Clique
- Vertex Cover
- Hamiltonian Circuit
- Traveling Salesman Problem

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Interact with the visualization:
   - Drag nodes to reposition them
   - Hover over nodes to see problem descriptions
   - Use the Reset View button to restore the default layout

## Implementation Details

Built using:
- D3.js for visualization
- HTML5/CSS3 for structure and styling
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity

## Future Enhancements

- Add more NP-complete problems
- Include detailed reduction proofs
- Add animation to show reduction steps
- Implement problem-specific visualizations
